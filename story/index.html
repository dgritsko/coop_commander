                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Let me tell you a story</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Friday, September 29, 2017 9:49 AM</p>
    
                <p>Ok. Let me tell you a story. Give you some info. Then get to the answer</p>
                  
                <p>When I was young, and even into adulthood , the critter I most feared was a rat. If you think of the movie batsman and how he feared bats. My fear of rats was pretty high. I saw them from time to time in a stream behind our house as a child - and they freaked me out. Well. Like batman over coming his greatest fear. I overcame mine. And although they are a huge nuisance they no longer freak me out.</p>

                <p>Ok on to facts. I learned a few years ago that mammals , like raccoons , skunks etc live where there is water. Food and shelter. They also learn where food is as each season changes. They are in the greatest need to search more for food as you move into the fall and winter. We created my science experiment bea cause the cat food kept getting left out on the porch and so I stArted trapping and moving possums , raccoons etc far away. That said. We had several generations of critters that kept looking for food on our porch. Over time we eliminated that as we relocated critters and did a much better job with the cat food. Ok on to the rats</p>
                  <p>The rats are the same. They need food water and shelter - and we kind of have the perfect thing for them in the duck and chicken pen. Although rats are everywhere. You rArely see them. You all have them also. But back to here. We only started to notice them a little over 2 years ago. But for sure we had them all along but weren't realizing it.</p>
                  <p>So I started trapping them. Started doing a much better job with the food. Etc but. That said. We were way behind the 8 ball. It took me really like a year or two to learn not just to trap , but how to trap, which traps worked better , where to put a trap. It took time to learn all this. Just so you know. You could think of the driveway as like a forcefield. The rats have never crossed it to my knowledge. And that is because of the cats. </p>
                  
                  <p>They are deadly effective on rats. So the rats stay away from the cats. That said. The rats live near the pen, and in the bamboo. And I think what happens is that rats also move around and the ones I am starting to see now are ones both that live here but others who know some generation back that there is s food source here.</p>
                  
                  <p>Ok. On a normal day st the moment I have usually 8 traps set in 2 areas and I can get none some nights or at times 1 - 3, usually smaller ones. Last night I tried a new method. We caught 23</p>
                  
                  <p>I will try the new method again tonight. I was shocked to see how well it worked. Normally bigger rats are really smart. But they were not smart at all last night</p>
                  
                  <p>I think we did serous damage to them last night.</p>
                  
                  <p>A friend of mine who is kind of bill nye the science guyish said a. Acre usually supports 35 rodents on average.</p>
                  
                  <p>Just an f y I</p>
                  
                  <p>Just also those weak at heart. They are nocturnal. You really don't see them- almost never in the day. Not to freak you out also but the tour areas of d c are infested with rats - and no I do t mean the politicians. At times I see dozens of them at night. But don't worry they are more afraid of you then you are of them. I've seen tons in n y c also</p>

                  <p><em>(commentary by various members of the family)</em></p>

                  <p>Now on to MY favorite part or the rat story</p>

                  <p>Always. And I mean always . I put the dead rats in a certain spot in the yard. And they always diasappear. Pardon my analogy but rats are like Starbucks in the animal world. Many larger mammals and birds of prey feed on them. At 9 am there were 23. Guess how many are already gone. My guess is to hawks of vultures.</p>
                  
                  <p>I was wondering if the whoever would be able to take so many. Take a guess on how many so far. ? This is also the reason I do t use rat poison.</p>

                <p><em>(various guesses)</em></p>

                <p>10 are already picked up by? Not sure what</p>
                  
              <p>I have used various rat traps that are basically larger mouse traps. Until last night that was my main line of defense until
                  It occurred to me to also try our 2 'catch the alive' traps. So I set them both and started catching them in bigger numbers. Late last night one group I caught was 5 at once. I won't get into how they went from being alive to dead. But each time I reset the traps. Like 20 minutes later I either caught more or they took the bait and the trap didn't close. One of them is inconsistent in springing. But I think that actually made it better as more rats got in</p>

                  <p>Last night was the first time I tried them. It almost seemed that the bigger rats -- who normally see you and are gone for the night. Just waited their turn to be caught</p>

                  <p>Ok correction. I see 3 rats were moved a distance but not taken. So 7 so far are gone and Caleb was correct</p>
                  
                  </p>

                    Update from rnn rat network news. Scottsville va, today 7 rats were bagged in an overnight cull at the beloved location known by Elijah gritsko --- as farm animals. The owner stated the success of last nights cull was no where near the historic number of 23, still the 7 represented the 2nd highest count ever recorded. The owner credited both traditional, new methods - including and invention by heralded wrestler John gritsko, and an additional unconventional method.</p>

                    <p>
                        I'll update more later. I am leading a tour at 10am. Pray it goes well . Tell Cait I'll get back on her email today

                  <p>Update on rat news network. Last night we.caught 2. Bringing the 3 day total to 32. More on the critter getting the rats. As if this morning only 12 of the 32 were left. As of 5 pm today they are all gone</p>

                <p>The other day I did some investigating. So far here's my theory</p>
                      
                    <p>When the rat bodies started disappearing I noticed 3 of them had been moved. Probably dropped. All in a line going towards the line of trees. As I have thought about it. I think either a fox or coyote grabbed a big group that day and dropped a few. I just think it is incredible that for many months this happens. But it's insane that whatever it is could take 32 from Friday morning till now</p>
                      
                      <p>That's the update

                    <p> Rnn. Rat network news. Caught 6 last night. After the big catch last week had several night where we did not catch any. Tried another new method and got the 6. Mind you the big catch last weekend was mostly large rats. The catch today was all small. Unfortunately the game cam was not in place until later today and the 6 were already gone. So in 7 days we got rid of 41.</p>

                      <p>This morning caught what I call a large class 3 rat. Meaning the biggest of the big. It's just under 15 inches</p>

                    <p>Good news is that there seem to be very few rats at the moment</p>
                  <p>I wanted an accurate way to reference it. It's about the size of a small squirrel

                <p>I wanted to give you all an update from Rat Network News. You may remember the stats. We ended last rat year, Sept 30th, having gotten 233 that year. With a big capture of rats, right at the end of that year, and into the first few days of October. Since October 1 until today, I have captured 50. Again, most of that number comes from the first few days of October. But the past few days have been highly successful. I have killed 2 large rats each night the past 3 nights, and 4 nights in a row I have caught at least 1 in the catch um alive trap. This string catching large ones is unprecedented. I think we are wiping out all local ones and proably ones migrating in. The next week or so will tell, but at this point, I have only been catching large ones, which seems to show there are no small or medium rats at all - at the moment, meaning we are close -  not sure to totally wiping them out. In the coming days, count on more updates from RNN..      </p>
